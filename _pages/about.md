I'm a research scientist in the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer team](https://institut-curie.org/team/barillot) at Institut Curie, Paris. I'm currently visiting at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo, within the [LIM31](https://limhc.fm.usp.br/portal/lim31-laboratorio-de-genetica-e-hematologia-molecular/). 

My main research focus is the modelling of biological systems.
I'm developing multiscale models, which integrate intracellular signalling into the simulation of biological tissues. I'm also developing methods to personalize these models and to make them specific to each patient, to produce personalized predictions.


I've been the lead developer of [MaBoSS](https://maboss.curie.fr), a continuous-time Boolean modelling framework, for more than 5 years. I've been working on **pyMaBoSS**, its Python bindings, and I'm developing cMaBoSS, its new Python bindings using the Python C API. I also developed [WebMaBoSS](https://maboss.curie.fr/webmaboss/), a web interface for getting started with MaBoSS, **ensembleMaBoSS** to simulate ensembles of Boolean networks, and **PopMaBoSS**, a multicellular pathway modelling framework.


Recently, I've been the lead developer of [PhysiBoSS](https://github.com/physiboss/physiboss), a [PhysiCell](https://physicell.org) addon for integrating intracellular signalling as a Boolean network. I also contributed to [PhysiMeSS](https://github.com/PhysiMeSS/PhysiMeSS), an addon for modelling fibres, and [PhysiCell Studio](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-Studio), the graphical interface for PhysiCell.
